# SnorkUnking 
Projet in Java A1 ISEP
> Very weird game created.

# Rules for playing 

It's a game about Snorkling , where you compete against another player. Each player needs to collect as much chest as possible, in there you will find some treasures that you need to bring back to the surface. /!\ But pay attention, you have a common oxygen level and the more chest you carry the faster the level drops ! 
Arrow Key are used to go left-right; up-down. Enter to take a chest when you are at the right level. 
Green Levels < Yellow < Red in terms of how much points/tresure you can find in chests

# To install

We recommend using Eclipse Java IDE to open this small project ( it's way easier to configure an external jar file )

1. Install Java JRE 9.02, below 9.02 will result in bad scaling in the app
2. Clone the repo, extract if needed
2. Install in the classpath directory the JAR file named stdlib-package.jar this is the GUI package we use
3. Execute the main.class 

# Disclaimer 

Some stuff are messy in here, big apologies, I had not learn the MVC architecture yet
Images and sounds where dropped in the root folder for convinience while switching from Linux to Windows.
